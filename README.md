# CE100--Logic-Design
Boolean algebra, logic minimization, finite-state machine design, sequential circuits, common logic elements, programmable logic devices, and an introduction to system level design. The electrical behavior of circuits including three state outputs, propagation delay, logic levels, and fanout

The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate my understanding of logic minimization, finite-state machine design, sequential circuits, common logic elements, programmable logic devices, and an introduction to system level design.
